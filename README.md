flutter_form_maker is a Flutter package that makes working with forms faster and easier. Instead of spending lots of time building and managing forms by hand, this package gives developers ready-to-use tools that handle everything — from simple text fields to advanced features like file pickers and signature pads. It’s especially useful for apps like document management systems, where users need to fill out and sign many forms.

What it is supposed to do:

- Controller management  
- Validation  
- Many field types  
- Form state (values, reset, clear)  
- Reactive/conditional updates  
- Dynamic forms (in some packages)  
- Theming  
- Dynamic JSON-based form schema (define fields from JSON/Map)  
- Auto-save and restore (save form progress locally)  
- Step-by-step / wizard forms with progress indicators  
- Conditional fields (show/hide based on other inputs)  
- Smart validation (password strength, email suggestion, async checks)  
- Extra field types (file/image picker, rich text, signature pad)  
- Reactive state linking (auto-update one field based on another)  
- Built-in theming presets (dark mode, error animations, custom styles)  
- Enhanced error UX (shake invalid fields, scroll to first error)  
- Form analytics & debug mode (track time spent, log all changes)
